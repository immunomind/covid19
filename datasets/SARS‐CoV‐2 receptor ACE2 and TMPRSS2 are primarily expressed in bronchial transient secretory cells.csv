Publication abstract/Press release,"The SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic affecting the human respiratory system severely challenges public health and urgently demands for increasing our understanding of COVID‐19 pathogenesis, especially host factors facilitating virus infection and replication. SARS‐CoV‐2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2. Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Our data provide a rich resource for future investigations of COVID‐19 infection and pathogenesis."

Sharing statement,"There are restrictions to the availability of the dataset due to potential risk of de‐identification of pseudonymized RNA sequencing data. Hence, the raw data will be available under controlled access in the following databases:      Single cell RNA sequencing data at European Genome‐Phenome Archive.     Single nuclei RNA sequencing data at European Genome‐Phenome Archive.  Further, our processed data can be accessed and mined through the following resources:      Count and metadata tables containing patient ID, sex, age, smoking status, cell type, and QC metrics for each cell:         FigShare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11981034.v1.         Mendeley: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7r2cwbw44m/1.     Mineable single cell gene expression data at: https://digital.bihealth.org/ and at: https://eils-lung.cells.ucsc.edu."
