Publication abstract\Press release,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)has caused more than40,000 deaths 42worldwide1.Approximately 14% of patients with COVID-19 experienced severe 43disease and 5% were critically ill2. Studies have shown that dysregulation of the 44COVID-19 patientsâ€™ immune system may lead to inflammatory stormand causesevere 45illness and even death3,4. Tocilizumab treatmenttargeting interleukin 6 receptor has 46shown inspiringclinical results of severe COVID-19 patients5.However,the immune 47network withTocilizumabtreatmentat single cell resolutionhas not been uncovered. 48Here, we profiled the single-cell transcriptomes of 13,289peripheral blood 49mononuclear cellsisolated at three longitudinalstages fromtwosevereCOVID-19 50patientstreated with Tocilizumab.Weidentifiedasevere stage-specific monocyte 51subpopulationand these cells centricimmune cell interaction network connected by the52inflammatory cytokines and their receptors.Theover-activated inflammatory immune53responsewasattenuatedafter Tocilizumab treatment, yet immune cells including 54plasma B cells and CD8+T cells still exhibited anintensehumoral and cell-mediated55anti-virus immune responsein recovered COVID-19 patients. These results provided56criticalinsights into the immunopathogenesisof severe COVID-19 and revealed 57fundamentalsof effectiveness inTocilizumab treatment."
