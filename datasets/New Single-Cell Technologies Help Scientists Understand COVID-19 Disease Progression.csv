Publication abstract/Press release,"Today, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) announced $750,000 in funding to support five distinct projects studying how COVID-19 progresses in patients at the level of individual cells and tissues. This work will generate some of the first single-cell biology datasets from donors infected by SARS-CoV2 and provide critical insights into how the virus infects humans, which cell types are involved, and how the disease progresses."
